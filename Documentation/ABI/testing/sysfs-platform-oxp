Description:
		Takeover TDP controls from the device. OneXPlayer devices have a
		turbo button that can be used to switch between two TDP modes
		(usually 15W and 25W). By setting this attribute to 1, this
		functionality is disabled, handing TDP control over to (Windows)
		userspace software and the Turbo button turns into a keyboard
		shortcut over the AT keyboard of the device. In addition,
		using this setting is a prerequisite for PWM control for most
		newer models (otherwise it NOOPs).
