  Memory Controller for an External Bus and Devices represents a block

  The NAND controller should be represented with its own DT node, and
  all NAND chips attached to this controller should be defined as
  children nodes of the NAND controller. This representation should be
  enforced even for simple controllers supporting only one chip.

  The ECC strength and ECC step size properties define the user
  desires in terms of correction capability of a controller. Together,
  they request the ECC engine to correct {strength} bit errors per
  {size} bytes.

  The interpretation of these parameters is implementation-defined, so
  not all implementations must support all possible
  combinations. However, implementations are encouraged to further
  specify the value(s) they support.
