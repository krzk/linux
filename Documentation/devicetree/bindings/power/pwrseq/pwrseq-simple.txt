* The simple power sequence provider

The purpose of the simple power sequence provider is to supports a set of
common properties between various SOC designs. It thus enables us to use the
same provider for several SOC designs.

The driver supports two types of bindings:
1. Property for any node
   Required properties:
   - power-sequence

2. Separate node (not recommended for new users)
   Required properties:
   - compatible : contains "mmc-pwrseq-simple".


Optional properties:
- reset-gpios : contains a list of GPIO specifiers. The reset GPIOs are asserted
	at initialization and prior we start the power up procedure of the card.
	They will be de-asserted right after the power has been provided to the
	card.
- clocks : Must contain an entry for the entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entry:
  "ext_clock" (External clock provided to the card).
- *-supply : If supplies are provided, the driver will enable and disable
             them during power sequence.

Example:

	sdhci0_pwrseq {
		compatible = "mmc-pwrseq-simple";
		reset-gpios = <&gpio1 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		clocks = <&clk_32768_ck>;
		clock-names = "ext_clock";
	}

	usb3503@08 {
		compatible = "smsc,usb3503";
		reg = <0x08>;

		intn-gpios = <&gpx3 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		connect-gpios = <&gpx3 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpx3 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		initial-mode = <1>;

		power-sequence;
		vdd-supply = <&buck8_reg>;
	};
